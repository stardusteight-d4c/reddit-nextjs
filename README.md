# Reddit Next.js | Supabase, Context API & SWR

![banner](banner.png)

> Clone the Reddit interface using `Supabase` as a backend as a service and using the `React Context API` to manage global application states such as the user session without using NextAuth.js (very common in Next.js projects). All this with super dynamic routes and real-time server responses thanks to the `SWR library`, in which the components will receive a constant and automatic stream of data updates and the user interface will always be fast and reactive. The base project was taught on the <strong>Clever Programmer</strong> channel.
